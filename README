Tests outside application code

Putting tests into an extra directory outside your actual application code might be useful if you have many functional
tests or for other reasons want to keep tests separate from actual application code (often a good idea):

https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/goodpractices.html
https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/pythonpath.html#pytest-vs-python-m-pytest

Executing pytest:
Call 'python -m pytest test/test_abc'

This is almost equivalent to invoking the command line script pytest [...] directly,
except that calling via python will also add the current directory to sys.path.

Option 1:
pyinstaller my_app/run_app1.py --onefile

Option 2:
pyinstaller run_app2.py --onefile
